**disclaimer**  

On all my social media accounts and websites, I only post what I currently recognize as valuable. The same applies to the works or lists of works currently uploaded to my accounts. My thoughts change from day to day, but I have no intention of concealing or erasing history. In the databases of copyright management organizations, records exist for almost all of my works. Regardless of whether they were uploaded legally or illegally, information will exist on someone’s account somewhere. I respect these records as historical facts (though I do not condone copyright infringement). The same applies to records of artists I have collaborated with.

There are a few people who, after I became involved with them, committed moral transgressions—for example, those who became sex offenders, those who dishonestly took advantage of me when I was a minor, or those who lied to me or betrayed my trust. That is their responsibility alone, and I am no longer involved with them, nor will I write their names here.

I also have many memories with people who are at no fault whatsoever. However, due to changes in my identity and values, I may, according to my own judgment, make those memories private. I will no longer promote their names or include them in my profile, but this too is part of my historical record. I have no intention of erasing or concealing it. As of now, I may look back on those memories as something beautiful, or I may see them as something cringe-worthy, but I will not go into further detail here and now.
