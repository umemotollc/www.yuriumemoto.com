Yuri Umemoto, born in Tokyo in 2002, is a composer whose works go beyond traditional scores and contemporary digital expressions, navigating East and West, the sacred and the secular, while capturing the intricate twists and distortions of a pluralistic identity beyond dualism. His music explores a maximalistic aesthetic, drawing inspiration from the vocal expressions of Japanese anime and the MAD-style sampling techniques of internet culture.  Growing up in a chaotic world where everything from Latin Gregorian chants to Japanese hentai games coexisted, his music emerges as obsessively self-referential.

His works have been performed by various ensembles, orchestras, and soloists internationally, and have been prominently featured in festivals such as the Thuringia Bach Festival, PODIUM Esslingen, zamus: early music festival, and the KÃ¶then Bach Festival.
